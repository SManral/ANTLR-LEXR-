Andrew worked on grammar rules getting them to work seperately 

Smriti worked on email grammar rule and validating rules with xml and json


Note for json last credit card and address must not have a ‘,’ at the end for it to be valid. We did it this way because it was like this in the instructions.
“CREDITCARD”: "4321-1111-2222-3333"“ADDRESS”:”226 Atanasoff Hall, Ames, IA 50011”


for xml tags should be lower case
For json check element should be upper case
